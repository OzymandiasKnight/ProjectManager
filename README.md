Work-Node is a project manager that allows to add notes, images (URL, copy pasted, or )
To make it work, you can either load the project in Godot Engine 4.4.1, play it, or you can compile to .exe with Project>Export>Windows>Export Project

In the main menu, you can add a project, with all the list of your projects.
Also you can press "escape" and changer the editor theme.
To interact you mainly double click or simply click on buttons/elements.

The most advanced part is the "Image Node" (Drag and drop nodes to add them)
You can add a Image from URL, from your Clipboard or drag and drop an image into the software window.
